# TIC TAC TOE

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using the DOM.

## How to Play:

- Open the Tic Tac Toe Game in your browser.
- The game starts with the circle's turn. Click on any empty square to place a circle in that position.
- Players take turns alternatively, placing their respective shapes (circle or cross) in empty squares.
- The first player to align three of their shapes in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
- If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players alternate turns to place their shapes on the board.
- Once a shape (circle or cross) is placed in a square, it cannot be changed or removed.
- The game will automatically detect a win or draw and display the result.
